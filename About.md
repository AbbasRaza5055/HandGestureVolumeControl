ðŸ§¾ About the Project
This project demonstrates how to use computer vision and hand tracking to create a touchless system volume controller. By using your webcam, the program detects your hand and adjusts the system volume based on the distance between your thumb and index finger. It integrates MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection, OpenCV for video processing, and Pycaw for audio control on Windows. This offers a practical example of gesture-based human-computer interaction in real time.
